# Breast Cancer Classification

## Description
This program performs breast cancer classification using machine learning algorithms on the breast cancer dataset. The dataset contains features computed from breast mass images, and the goal is to classify whether a given mass is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

The program applies various machine learning techniques to train models on the dataset and predict the class labels. It helps in diagnosing breast cancer and provides a tool for medical professionals to make informed decisions based on the classification results.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: The program preprocesses the breast cancer dataset, handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization if necessary.
- Feature selection: It performs feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for the classification task.
- Model training: The program trains different machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks, to learn from the data and classify breast masses.
- Model evaluation: It evaluates the trained models using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess their performance.
- Predictions: The program allows making predictions on new, unseen breast mass data using the trained models.

## Usage
1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Prepare the dataset by downloading `data.csv` and placing it in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the `breast_cancer_classification.py` script to preprocess the data, train models, and make predictions.
4. Adjust the script parameters and model configurations as needed.
5. Analyze the results, evaluate model performance, and interpret the predictions.

## Dataset
The breast cancer dataset (`data.csv`) used in this program contains information about various features extracted from breast mass images, including texture, area, smoothness, and more. It also provides the corresponding class labels indicating whether a mass is malignant (1) or benign (0).
